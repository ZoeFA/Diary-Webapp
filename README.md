# Diary-Webapp
A simple diary webapp.

In order to run my web app, you must have the XAMPP control panel. In the XAMPP program files you will need to put the program files (or folder) into the htdocs folder. Start Apache and then MySQL. Next you will have to create a database called “journaldb” in phpMyAdmin. Create two tables: journalentries, and users. The sql files have been provided in the “database-files” folder, so you only need to import. I recommended creating the database yourself first (not importing the file), and then importing the tables. Then click on the following url. You may need to alter this url, depending on the file path of the project files: http://localhost/credit-project/login.php
